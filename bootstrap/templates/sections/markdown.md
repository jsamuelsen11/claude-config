## Markdown Conventions

- One sentence per line (semantic line breaks) for clean diffs
- ATX-style headings (`#`) with blank line before and after
- Reference-style links for repeated URLs
- Fenced code blocks: always specify the language identifier
- Ordered lists: use `1.` for all items (auto-numbering)
- Lint with markdownlint — fix all warnings before commit
- README: title, description, quick start, usage, contributing, license
- Keep line length under 120 characters where practical
